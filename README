pympd is an alternative python interface to mpd that uses twisted. I
wrote it because I was having trouble with mpdclient often falling
into a bad state and not taking commands; and because my programs use
the twisted event loop and would rather not block for whatever
mpdclient does.

Depends on twisted from http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/
